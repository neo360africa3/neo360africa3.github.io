    "body": "2019/10/09 - SMEs create 2 out of every 3 new jobs! Despite this, they are often overlooked and underserved. Small and Medium Scale Enterprises are responsible for the development of new products and services which keeps the economy going. Due to its dynamic nature, SMEs are prone to a high mortality rate caused by sudden shifts in economic policies amongst other factors. According to research, more than half of SMEs are unable to fund their business ambitions. While there might be an increase in revenue, some find it difficult to reach their business goals. Some of these goals include employing more staff, opening other branches, launching new products and more.  However, challenges faced by SMEs include lack of access to affordable finance, skilled workforce, multiplicity of taxes, high cost of doing business, huge gaps in infrastructure and more. Some SMEs were able to share the challenges they face.  “I own a small shop in Yaba where I sell clothes and business has been good. I make an average of 150 to 300 thousand naira per month and would love to open another shop in Lagos market, but the responsibilities are too much. I am a widow and have to send my two children to school, I also have to pay rent, in fact, I still take care of my late husband’s mother. I thank God things have been good, but I really wish to open another shop. ” “I started a laundry business in 2017 where I wash, iron and mend clothes for people. I want to grow bigger than this, but not many people are interested in what I’m doing. Some people think it’s just to wash and iron, but it’s more than that and takes a lot of skill. Because of the lack of interest, I’ve also lost employees. Some end up damaging the clothes, while others run away with them to sell. Another issue is power. They don’t provide us with enough electricity, so I have a backup generator. The cost of maintaining the generator and servicing it is not easy. I also have to buy fuel regularly. If all these costs were not there, I believe I would have gone far by now. ” Without the necessary funds and facilities to grow, the economy will remain stagnant and entrepreneurs will lose their businesses.

    "body": "2019/10/09 - You went to work on Monday, visited a client on Tuesday, went to the market on Wednesday, went to work on Thursday, thank God it’s Friday.  What are you doing this weekend? Attending a wedding? Sleeping in? Or one of your customers just called and asked for an impromptu job? Or maybe your employees are misbehaving? Being an entrepreneur is not all about work. You should take some time to unwind and have fun. Despite all the motivational quotes that say “work now, play later” or “I don’t take breaks”, it is important that you do take a break. Such would be good for your health. Whilst trying to satisfy your clients, you also should be satisfied. Enjoy yourself, take a break. Relax! If you don’t know how to, here is a list of fun things to do in Lagos for the weekend. Go to the cinema (Or stay at home and chill with Netflix) It’s like nobody even has time for television these days, you get home and you’re on your phone… chatting, scrolling through pictures or just watching random videos on Twitter. You can’t even sit for a few minutes to check out the news on TV. Your major news provider is probably Instablog or Pulse. It’s understandable. Why don’t you drop the phone for a while and visit the cinema? If you don’t want to, chill at home with Netflix and enjoy one or two movies. It’s just an hour or two (make sure you switch off your phone, so you have rest of mind). You will feel better after. Ensure it’s a genre you like, it could be comedy, romance or Sci-Fi… whatever it is that will entertain you. Go to the beach Lagos is full of beaches. There is Elegushi Beach, Tarkwa Bay Beach, Oniru Beach, La Campagne Tropicana Beach Resort, Coconut Beach and many more. These beaches and resorts have perfect views and come with other fun packages such as sports facilities, fine dining, lounges, games and many more. It is an opportunity to take a break from the business world and focus on yourself, friends and family. Appreciate art and beauty at the Nike Art Gallery Nike Art Gallery is filled with over a thousand works of art of different genres, ranging from textiles to bead work. Don’t go there just to view the art, but appreciate it. Remember that the artists are entrepreneurs like yourself. Entrance is free and if you appreciate the art enough to buy something, there is a gift shop available in the gallery. Why not support a fellow entrepreneur? Go paintballing Are your employees finding it difficult to work with themselves? Take them paintballing. They will learn by force. Paintballing is an activity that involves shooting people on the opposite team with a fake gun filled with pellets of paint. If you’re too serious at work, it sure would bring out your fun side. Go to the Lekki Conservation Centre If you live in Lagos and you haven’t been here, do you really live in Lagos? And you call yourself a Lagosian… okay, work never allowed you. Well, why not take a break and visit the Lekki Conservation Centre? It is one of the top nature reserves in Nigeria with calm scenery. It is also very popular for having the longest canopy walk in Africa. LCC is definitely one of the top places to unwind and let go. So, dear entrepreneurs, how would you be spending your weekend? Other fun and enlightening activities coming soon include: · Lagos Digital Marketing Training – October 12th 2019 · Africa Oil &amp; Gas Talent Summit 2019 – October 30th 2019 · Lagos Expo 2019: Fashion – November 30th 2019 HAVE FUN!

    "body": "2019/10/09 - The customer is always right. Is this true? It can be quite tough for entrepreneurs when they put in a lot of effort into a product and are not appreciated for it.  However, Sean Harper, co-founder of Kin Insurance says, “Feedback is useful. Once I started thinking this way, it made me realize I’m grateful for the opportunity to see an experience from another point of view and hopefully improve. ”Not many people know how to take such feedback. Here are a few things to do when faced with an angry customer: Understand the problem: In order to understand the problem, one should keep quiet, listen and reflect on what they’ve been told. Understanding the problem would enable you proffer a valuable solution to it. This would prevent more problems and enable customer satisfaction. Apologise: Whether you agree with the customer or not, an apology should be given. This shows that you care and are interested in the customer’s opinions. After rendering the apology, engage them in conversation to know what can be done to serve them better. However, do not over apologise and feel too guilty, some people may take that for granted and try to belittle you. Do not let your emotions kick in: Negative feedback should not be taken too personal. Embrace criticism and use it as an opportunity to improve on your business. Learn from your mistakes and move on. Learn from Mauricio Cardenal who says;“One of the most profound lessons I’ve learned in my life is that we should not take things too personally. Yes, negative feedback is painful sometimes, but I know that my actions aren’t a reflection of me. ” Identify the cause of the problem:  Identifying the cause of the problem is one of the first steps to take in order to avoid negative feedback another time. If a customer wasn’t satisfied with the product or service provided, try to identify what went wrong. See it as an opportunity to improve: While not everyone is open to criticism and negative feedback, some use it as an opportunity to improve. This leads to increased performance and productivity. "

    "title": "Key factors to consider before business expansion",
    "body": "2019/10/09 - Business expansion is sometimes critical for increased market share or even survival, however, if not done properly could lead to the downfall of the business. At the same time if done too early, it could result in the business crumbling and if done too late, could result in losing market share and relevance. To be frank, expansion isn’t just about more revenues. You want to think sustainability, wider reach, business development, innovation and of course, more money. Expansion is really all encompassing. So how do you know if your small business is ready for expansion? Structure, Systems and Processes: Is your business rightly structured to manage the diversity that comes with growth? Do you have processes within your business to ensure quality across board and maintenance of your core values? Will your business shred apart when you go for a 3 months vacation? If you answered in the negative, then your business isn’t ready for growth. It doesn’t really matter how much you are making in revenue and profits if your business revolves around you. If you do not institute structure, processes and systems in your business, test them for a while before expanding, then you may cause problems for your business. Human Capacity: Do you have the requisite manpower to manage the additional demands that accompany expansion? What is the composition of your team in terms of expertise, skills and intellectual range? If you cannot confidently beat your chest in response to these questions, then you have to hold off expansion until you have the right people on your team and they are well trained to handle the pressure of expansion. On the other hand, if your business is hard pressed to expand and you don’t have the required capital, you can get financing to hire additional staff then proceed to expand. Cash Flow:  Cash flow is inherently different from generating sales revenues. If after deducting your production costs, variable costs and there is barely any reasonable profit commensurate to the effort, resources and time put into the production and sales cycle or the profit can barely even cover marketing. Scalability: If your business is really growing, then you should not have to spend so much more to increase your revenue base. This means if you spend ₦250,000 to produce 1000 units of a product (which translates into ₦250 per 1 unit of product), then you should not be spending beyond ₦350,000 to produce 1500 units. With economies of scale, increased revenues should not cost more to deliver than current revenues. Customer Segment: This involves having an increased demand for your product or services and also diversifying your revenue sources. When you have an increased demand for your products, then you want to start thinking about expansion. However, you have to first ensure that your team can meet up with production and after sales services. On the other hand, if 40% of your revenue comes from a particular client, especially for B2B businesses, then you might have to expand your business to acquire more customers. The danger of having 40% of your revenue from one source is not sustainable in the long run. Market Analysis: You don’t just wake up one morning and decide to expand your business from Lagos to Abuja or from Nigeria to London without taking the time to analyse the new market. Apart from regulatory requirements, customers in this region are probably meeting their needs with available products or close substitutes. More so, they have certain preferences that might be a tad different from that of your current customer base. So, you need to carry out a comprehensive market analysis to ascertain if your business can thrive in the intended market or if you need some iteration of your product or marketing strategy. Does your business tick all these boxes but lack the needed finance for expansion? Or you still need some clarity on how to go about your expansion?

    "title": "The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format",
    "body": "2018/06/12 - The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: 123. my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example: "

    "body": "2018/05/12 - gem install bundler installs the bundler gem through RubyGems. You only need to install it once - not every time you create a new Jekyll project. Here are some additional details: bundler is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires. The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts. For more information about how to use Bundler in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly. "

    "body": "2018/01/12 - As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them. So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it. Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.

    "title": "Let's test spoilers",
    "body": "2018/01/11 - Director Roland Suso Richter’s enigmatic psychological thriller (direct to video/DVD) was based upon screenwriter Michael Cooney’s own play “Point of Death” - a title that gave away the film’s entire plot twist premise. As in many similar films, such as Jacob’s Ladder (1990), Soul Survivors (2001), and The Butterfly Effect (2004), events and people were thoroughly distorted and confused because the protagonist was at the point of death. The tagline was misleading: “When You Don’t Have a Memory, How Can You Remember Who to Trust?” The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident – but he had been revived (“You’re as good as new”). Dr. Newman: “Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside. ” (The doctor left off four crucial additional words, revealed in the film’s ending. ) (Spoiler: Simon had died and was not resuscitated!). A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there’s a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is. So how do we do spoilers?: 1&lt;span class= spoiler &gt;My hidden paragraph here. &lt;/span&gt;"
