Being an entrepreneur is quite a challenge. While it is important to focus on your business and ensure things are going well, your health deserves a substantial amount of time and attention. If you don’t take care of yourself, you are setting yourself and your business up for some relapse.
Why not make your health a priority?

# Nourish your body

A healthy diet is very important. Your nutrition affects other aspects of your life such as energy, productivity, mental health and emotions. This may be difficult for some because of certain factors, however it is important to make conscious effort to maintain a healthy diet. This includes eating breakfast (remember, it’s the most important meal of the day), drink lots of water, eat a variety of foods, not the same thing every day (this might be hard since we consume a lot of rice here), eat your fruits and vegetables.

# Exercise regularly

While there might not be enough time to go for a jog every morning, you could engage in subtle forms of exercise. Take the stairs instead of using the elevator, walk to the bus stop or car park. You could also engage yourself and your colleagues in team exercises. Dedicate Fridays to fitness day.

# Get enough sleep

If you’re in Lagos, you might just laugh this off. With the amount of time we spend in Lagos traffic, it might seem impossible. Depending on the hours you work, and the time you spend on the road, you should be able to get adequate sleep to enable you work effectively the next day.

# Take time off

Sometimes, you just need to unwind and stay away. Take some time off for yourself and take care. You may decide to put your phone away too to avoid distractions. Travel, meditate, think positively.
