Did you know that entrepreneurs are superheroes? Yes! You are a superhero. This is because you play a very significant role in the country’s development. Without you, will Nigeria thrive? You contribute to the economy, you take risks, you make impact. Here’s an acronym that best defines you as a superhero.

**S – SELF LESS**

Putting the needs of others before one’s self is selflessness. Before making decisions and taking action, entrepreneurs are quick to consider the needs of their customers first and if they will be satisfied.

**U – USEFUL**

Entrepreneurs are useful. They are useful to manufacturers, their clients, finance industries, the government and even various individuals. Why? They create job opportunities, they purchase products for business, they contribute to the economy, and they render useful services. What would we do without you?

**P – PASSIONATE**

The passion which entrepreneurs use to work and engage in their business cannot be missed. It’s this passion that drives them to provide quality goods and services for their customers. 

**E – ENTHUSIASTIC**

Entrepreneurs are highly enthusiastic about what they do. This goes well with their passion and pushes them to work hard to satisfy their customers.

**R – RISK TAKER**

Numerous entrepreneurs have sacrificed their valuable resources, life savings, even their lives just to start a business. They always find themselves involved with risks. Will they succeed? Is it worth it? Can I trust this partner? Risk-taking is a unique quality that everybody cannot get involved in. 

**H – HARDWORKING**

Some entrepreneurs work 9 to 5 as well as run their businesses, some operate 24/7, always looking for innovative methods to adopt to help satisfy their customers. Entrepreneurs are the real MVPs!

**E – EXTRAORDINARY**

Entrepreneurs are no ordinary human beings. They have special abilities which require them to work harder than others. 

**R – RESPONSIBLE**

With great power comes great responsibility. To be able to run a successful business, one requires responsibility. Full time responsibility, this includes responsibility to make decisions, responsibility to take actions, responsibility to do the needful in order for the business to thrive.

**O – ORGANISED**

Entrepreneurs are organised in their dealings. They plan ahead, they ensure they meet up with deadlines, they fulfill their tasks diligently in order to make room for more.

This is to appreciate entrepreneurs for all the hard work they put in to satisfying their customers and for being a part of NEO360 Africa. We appreciate you. You all are super heroes.
