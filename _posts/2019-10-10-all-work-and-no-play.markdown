You went to work on Monday, visited a client on Tuesday, went to the market on Wednesday, went to work on Thursday, thank God it's Friday.

What are you doing this weekend? Attending a wedding? Sleeping in? Or one of your customers just called and asked for an impromptu job?

Being an entrepreneur is not all about work. You should take some time to unwind and have fun. Despite all the big men quotes that say “work now, play later” or “I don’t take breaks”, it is important that you do take a break. Such would be good for your health. Whilst trying to satisfy your clients, you also should be satisfied. Enjoy yourself, take a break. Relax! If you don’t know how to, here is a list of fun things to do in Lagos for the weekend.

## 1. GO TO THE CINEMA (OR STAY AT HOME AND CHILL WITH NETFLIX)

It’s like nobody even has time for TV these days, you get home and you’re on your phone… chatting, scrolling through pictures or just watching random videos on Twitter or Instagram. You can’t even sit for a few minutes to check out the news on TV. Your major news provider is probably Instablog or Pulse. It’s understandable. Why don’t you drop the phone for a while and visit the cinema? If you don’t want to, chill at home with Netflix and enjoy one or two movies. It’s just an hour or two (make sure you switch off your phone, so you have rest of mind). You will feel better after. Ensure it’s a genre you like, it could be comedy, romance or Sci-Fi… whatever it is that will entertain you.

## 2. GO TO THE BEACH

Lagos is full of beaches. There is Elegushi Beach, Tarkwa Bay Beach, Oniru Beach, La Campagne Tropicana Beach Resort, Coconut Beach and many more. These beaches and resorts have perfect views and come with other fun packages such as sports facilities, fine dining, lounges, games and many more. It is an opportunity to take a break from the business world and focus on yourself, friends and family.

## 3. APPRECIATE ART AND BEAUTY AT THE NIKE ART GALLERY

Nike Art Gallery is filled with over a thousand works of art of different genres, ranging from textiles to bead work. Don’t go there just to view the art, but appreciate it. Remember that the artists are entrepreneurs like yourself. Entrance is free and if you appreciate the art enough to buy something, there is a gift shop available in the gallery. Why not support a fellow entrepreneur?

## 4. GO PAINTBALLING

Are your employees finding it difficult to work with themselves? Take them paintballing. They will learn by force. Paintballing is an activity that involves shooting people on the opposite team with a fake gun filled with pellets of paint. If you’re too serious at work, it sure would bring out your fun side.

## 5. GO TO THE LEKKI CONSERVATION CENTRE

If you live in Lagos and you haven’t been here, do you really live in Lagos? And you call yourself a Lagosian… okay, work never allowed you. Well, why not take a break and visit the Lekki Conservation Centre? It is one of the top nature reserves in Nigeria with calm scenery. It is also very popular for having the longest canopy walk in Africa. LCC is definitely one of the top places to unwind and let go.
