NEO360 Africa went to visit some entrepreneurs and asked them how they were preparing for the event.


*“I’m really excited for this year’s Black Friday. To me, Black Friday is more like a clearance deal so the items that have been in the store for a while are sold at a discount. This gives room for new items in December and at the beginning of the year.”* – Kemi (Fashion)


*“I don’t see Black Friday as a big deal, so I do not participate in it. I don’t want to sell my goods at a slashed price.”* – Oge (Fashion)


*“I’m not taking Black Friday too seriously. I’m just doing a little promo. The first 29 people that order food worth 2,500 and above get free delivery. I chose 29 because Black Friday is on the 29th.”* – Ella (Food production)


*“I’m almost ready for Black Friday. I’m just waiting for goods to arrive. I see Black Friday as a way to give to the community. I don’t know, but I feel like it’ll be good to sell goods at a discount for those who can’t normally afford it.”* – Doris (Fashion)


We are as excited as you are for this Black Friday. Don’t get too excited though. We have a few tips to help you prepare for Black Friday.


### Expect the unexpected 

Since most people and industries seem to be participating in Black Friday deals, the competition is going to be tighter than usual. Their discounts may be higher, their products may be cheaper, so don’t put all your eggs in one basket and think it’s going to be a hit. There might be some challenges. 


### Don’t be a copycat 

If your competition slashes prices by half, you shouldn’t give a higher discount to attract more people. That’s risky. Remember that you are not being supplied by the same person. Ensure that your price slashes are realistic so as not to attract a huge loss.


### Make good use of social media
 
Social media is an efficient marketing tool. Use it to promote sales and create awareness. Let the world know that you have huge sales coming up. Engage with influencers, use the trending hashtags. This would definitely boost your sales on Black Friday.


### Appreciate your customers
 
Once Black Friday is over, do make sure you appreciate your customers. Some might not remember you till the next black Friday. To keep your customers loyal, appreciate them and show them how much you care. Remember them after the sales, so they can come back.


We hope you have a wonderful Black Friday!
