Entrepreneurship is not all about making money, it often involves innovation and taking risks.
Onouha defines it as “the practice of starting new organisations or revitalising mature organisations, particularly new businesses generally in response to identified opportunities.” <br/>

To make it as an entrepreneur, characteristics such as passion, purpose, focus and perseverance are needed. One who lacks such characteristics may not succeed.

Successful entrepreneurs always follow their passion. Passion is required to push you and keep you going in the field. It is your driving force. If you don’t have passion for what you are doing, then why are you really doing it? Individuals interested in fields such as fashion, make up, farming, cooking and more have created successful businesses out of their passion. What is yours?

### **Purpose**

You’ve identified your passion, so what’s your purpose? Myles Munroe said *“where the purpose of a thing is not known, abuse is inevitable.”* As an entrepreneur, what is your purpose? What is your aim, your vision? Is it just to make money? Is it to make impact? In order to succeed in your business, you have to know your purpose so you won’t give up easily.

### **Focus**

Focus produces valuable results. as an entrepreneur, if you lack focus, you tend to become easily distracted by various factors such as the economy, various policies and other challenges. Stay focused!
