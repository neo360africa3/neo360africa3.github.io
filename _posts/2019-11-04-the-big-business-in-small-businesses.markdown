As an entrepreneur, how do you see yourself? Yes, you may be referred to as an SME, “A Small and Medium Enterprise”, but you are more than that. You play a huge role in the nation’s development and that’s some bragging right with your focus cap still on. Do not let your size stop you from making waves in the industry. 
As an SME, you are a key player in the country’s economic advancement plan. SMEs have been proven to account for over 46% of the global GDP in the last 5 years and account for 96% of the entire business sector in Nigeria. 
You may be small, but you play a huge role. You support local communities, provide essential services and develop innovative new products. You also contribute a lot to the country’s tax revenue. In fact, **you are the unacknowledged heroes of our economy and you deserve recognition all year long **!(http://https://www.blog.neo360africa.com/the-super-entrepreneur/)
You are highly responsible for the alleviation of poverty in the nation and contribute significantly to the employment rate. Despite the huge unemployment rate, SMEs have been able to mitigate the rate by providing jobs on different levels. Statistics reveal that SMEs are responsible for 30-50% of household income and account for over 84% of the Nigerian labor force
SMEs are highly innovative. The research and development process can be a very cumbersome process, but many creative ideas often come from small businesses. The huge number of ideas commercialized and marketed by the big businesses come from small businesses. The creative and ingenious mind of entrepreneurs creates room for rapid solution to problems in various sectors of business. They also utilize the unexplored local raw materials to solve these problems; which has significantly helped increase foreign trade as well.
SMEs should not be intimidated by big businesses but should rather pursue a partnership with them in terms of marketing, finance, distribution and more to create more impact in the economy. In fact it has been proven that the big businesses need the small businesses to thrive and that is YOU.
