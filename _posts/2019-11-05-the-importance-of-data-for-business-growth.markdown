*“The best-run companies are data-driven, and this skill sets businesses apart from their competition.” – Tomasz Tunguz*


Over the years, the use of data has been targeted towards large firms and established companies. However, with the advancement in technology, data can now be easily accessed by individuals as well as small businesses. Data can be used by SMEs in various ways to improve productivity and expand business.


Data facilitates the decision making process. When I want to purchase a new item or visit a place, the first thing I do is read the reviews. This aids my decision making process. Is it worth it or not? Are there better options? This is the same way data and information facilitates the decision making process of an SME in business. You are thinking of expanding your business, maybe you want to open another branch; you need accurate data to help you know if you truly need business expansion. Before making important business decisions, read and gather enough data and information to help you make the best decision.


Data provides a better understanding of the target audience. Thanks to the information gathered as interaction with customers occurs, the perfect demographical statistics of the customer base is known. Such data includes the age range, gender, educational background, most ordered item, places of delivery, price range of items ordered. After gathering such information, a proper understanding of the target audience is known, so products and services are made to meet the needs of the target audience.


Data helps measure productivity and performance. Based on the data provided in bookkeeping records and accounts, as well as the cash flow of the business, the performance of the business can be seen and measured. Where did it go wrong? Where is the error? When such data is seen and accurately measured, corrections can be made to boost the performance and productivity of the business.
