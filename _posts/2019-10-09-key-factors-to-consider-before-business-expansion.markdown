Business expansion is sometimes critical for increased market share or even survival, however, if not done properly could lead to the downfall of the business. At the same time if done too early, it could result in the business crumbling and if done too late, could result in losing market share and relevance. <br/>
To be frank, expansion isn't just about more revenues. You want to think **sustainability**, **wider reach**, **business development**, **innovation** **and of course**, **more money**. Expansion is really all encompassing. So how do you know if your small business is ready for expansion?

## **Structure, Systems and Processes**

Is your business rightly structured to manage the diversity that comes with growth? Do you have processes within your business to ensure quality across board and maintenance of your core values? Will your business shred apart when you go for a 3 months vacation? If you answered in the negative, then your business isn’t ready for growth. It doesn’t really matter how much you are making in revenue and profits if your business revolves around you. If you do not institute structure, processes and systems in your business, test them for a while before expanding, then you may cause problems for your business.

## **Human Capacity**

Do you have the requisite manpower to manage the additional demands that accompany expansion? What is the composition of your team in terms of expertise, skills and intellectual range? <br/>
If you cannot confidently beat your chest in response to these questions, then you have to hold off expansion until you have the right people on your team and they are well trained to handle the pressure of expansion. On the other hand, if your business is hard pressed to expand and you don't have the required capital, you can get financing to hire additional staff then proceed to expand.

## **Cash Flow**

Cash flow is inherently different from generating sales revenues. If after deducting your production costs, variable costs and there is barely any reasonable profit commensurate to the effort, resources and time put into the production and sales cycle or the profit can barely even cover marketing.

## **Scalability**

If your business is really growing, then you should not have to spend so much more to increase your revenue base. This means if you spend ₦250,000 to produce 1000 units of a product (which translates into ₦250 per 1 unit of product), then you should not be spending beyond ₦350,000 to produce 1500 units. With economies of scale, increased revenues should not cost more to deliver than current revenues.

## **Customer Segment**

This involves having an increased demand for your product or services and also diversifying your revenue sources. When you have an increased demand for your products, then you want to start thinking about expansion. However, you have to first ensure that your team can meet up with production and after sales services. On the other hand, if 40% of your revenue comes from a particular client, especially for B2B businesses, then you might have to expand your business to acquire more customers. The danger of having 40% of your revenue from one source is not sustainable in the long run.

## **Market Analysis**

You don’t just wake up one morning and decide to expand your business from Lagos to Abuja or from Nigeria to London without taking the time to analyse the new market. Apart from regulatory requirements, customers in this region are probably meeting their needs with available products or close substitutes. More so, they have certain preferences that might be a tad different from that of your current customer base. So, you need to carry out a comprehensive market analysis to ascertain if your business can thrive in the intended market or if you need some iteration of your product or marketing strategy.
