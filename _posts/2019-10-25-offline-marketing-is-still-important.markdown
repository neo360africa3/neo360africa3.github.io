With the increase in the advent of technology, various individuals and businesses have abandoned the use of traditional and offline media to market and advertise. SMEs should remember that these traditional methods are also very effective. 


* **Word of mouth** – You cannot introduce yourself without telling someone what you do for a living. That’s marketing. Next time, don’t just say it casually “I’m a designer”, feel free to express it in a way that makes people want to know more about you and your business. Say “I’m a visual artist that specialises in the creation of images and designs” This leads to more questions.


* **Business cards** – You can’t be an entrepreneur and not have a business card. These cards should be taken everywhere with you to share with potential investors and customers. While word of mouth may also be effective, the business card makes them remember you and what you do. It is also necessary for contact reasons. 


* **Flyers, stickers and billboards** – These methods are effective and less costly than online advertising. The flyers and stickers should contain adequate information so they can be read and understood within a short minute. These stickers can be placed on cars, doors and gates to let passers-by know what you are into. Who knows? Your target customer might just be one of them.


* **Branded items** – Branded items such as Tee shirts, tote bags, cups, pens, notepads and more are good marketing utensils. People see the design and logo and wonder what the business is all about. This gives an opportunity to market your business to individuals. 


* **Newspaper and magazine ads** – Believe it or not, people still purchase hard copy newspapers and are always seeking to know more through them. This medium is very effective, especially for older people who may not be familiar with using the internet. If everybody uses the internet for marketing, who reaches out to them?
