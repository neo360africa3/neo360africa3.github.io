As an entrepreneur, you should be able to represent your brand effectively. The truth is, customers easily relate with individuals than brands. According to statistics from the Impact Learning Centre, with the current growth in social media engagements, 77% of consumers are more likely to buy from a company with a CEO that’s active on social media. Sometimes, it’s not just about the brand, but about the person behind the brand. While promoting your brand is a big deal, there are other reasons why you good brand representation is important.


### Personal branding makes your product unique

As Fenty Beauty is to Rihanna, Kylie Cosmetics is to Kylie Jenner. People purchase these products not necessarily because of the quality or the beauty, but because of the people behind it. These names are the selling points of these products. What is the name behind your brand? In Nigeria, we can associate Mag Diva’s Boutique to Mercy Aigbe, Tiffany Amber to Folake Coker, Jewel by Lisa to Lisa Folawiyo and Elizabeth R to Ibidunni Ighodalo. You may not be a popular celebrity, but ensure that you provide content good enough for your target audience, so when they get to the market and see your product, they’ll select it out of the others because they know the name behind it and can easily relate with the owner.


### Personal branding builds credibility

Statistics from the Impact Learning Centre also reveals that 82% of consumers are more likely to trust a company with an active CEO on social media. Sometimes, individuals purchase a product for the first time because of what they’ve heard or seen about it in adverts. Sometimes, because it has been endorsed by a particular celebrity. If you cannot afford to get your products endorsed by celebrities, be your own celebrity. Endorse your own products, toot your own horn. This would make individuals purchase your product because it has been highly recommended and publicised. If they trust you, they will trust your product.



*If you really want your business to succeed, you have to put yourself out there. It’s not just about your image, but also your character. If you’re honest, transparent and legit in your dealings and conversations, people would be glad to do business with you and patronise you. Ensure you’re always in a positive light and you will portray a good image for your brand as well.
Luckily, NEO360 offers advisory sessions, so you would be able to know how to best represent your company as a person.*
