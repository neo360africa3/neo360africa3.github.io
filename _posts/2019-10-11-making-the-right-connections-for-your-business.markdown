One of the challenges entrepreneurs face is standing out in the crowd. The competition out there is tough, so it is important to create a niche for yourself that differentiates you from your competitors. Established brands like Coca-Cola, Apple and others have been able to stand out in their various industries because of outstanding and unique features they possess.
How can you stand out in the market? Is everybody venturing into the same field you are in? Here are 5 ways to effectively stand out among your competition:

## Identify your target market

Identification of your target market is very important. This would help you make other important decisions such as price, quality and more. For example, fashion designing is a popular skill in Nigeria. You could walk down a street and see up to fifteen clothing and design stores. If your target market is for the rich and wealthy, then you would design and tailor clothes fit for the rich and wealthy, with top notch materials and accessories.

## Engage your customers

It’s one thing to have your market, while it’s another thing to engage them. Find out what it is that they want. Identify their needs and mold your brand to suit those needs. Engaging your customers shows that you are interested in them and develops your relationship with them, thus improving their loyalty to your brand. Engaging your customers could be done face to face, via social media and other feedback platforms.

## Do something new

It’s out with the old and in with the new. Revamp your brand by adopting new techniques and processes in the implementation of your product. The fact that your business is the only one making use of such new processes and adoptions would make you stand out. For example, fashion in Nigeria has evolved over the years. A fashion designer is always coming up with new trends that have not been seen before, making clients look unique from the crowd.

## Add a plus

Why not go the extra mile? The plus should be a benefit that comes with a paid product or service. Such additions have people looking forward to working with you. Examples include free delivery, a certain percentage based on the number of items bought, freebies and many more. It encourages people and keeps customers loyal.

## Engage in Corporate Social Responsibility

Experts say it is important to give back to the society, even as you satisfy the needs of your customers. CSR projects attract more customers, increase your goodwill and public image, while also making you stand out in your field. People always want to know who made positive impact around them. Some corporate social responsibility projects include going green (recycling), giving to the less privileged, fighting for human rights and many more. There are numerous CSR activities one could engage in to improve their business status.
