Ethics could refer to moral guidelines or principles that govern one’s behaviour. In business, it is the application of the right values in business behaviour. For an entrepreneur, business ethics are required to govern one’s way of doing business. Here are a few reasons why ethics should be maintained in business.


**It is necessary to develop a good reputation.** This boosts the positive image and brand of the business which could lead to an increase in the customer and client base. Everyone wants to do business with a company that has good reviews and reputations.


**Performing ethically in business encourages customer loyalty and trust.** Behaving ethically could include treating your customers well, responding promptly to complaints and not taking advantage of them or ripping them off. Customer loyalty eventually leads to the success and lifelong existence of a business.


**Business ethics develop investor and partner loyalty.** Individuals would not want to invest or work with a shady, corrupt business that operates unethically. A high degree of trust is established, which makes it easy and comfortable to work with you.


**Following ethical principles in business avoids legal problems and scandals.** A business with proper ethics would not cheat or disobey certain laws to get ahead as the repercussion of such actions could bring about legal damages. Sometimes, it may be difficult to perform ethically, depending on the type of people you are surrounded by, but you should stand out as a business to follow business ethics. 


**Working ethically in business opens up limitless opportunities for businesses.** Ensure that you follow all the rules and policies of the country and establish a good reputation.
