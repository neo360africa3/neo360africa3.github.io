There are various methods of investment in Nigeria, such as stocks, bonds, shares, mutual funds, treasury bills and more. Over the years, treasury bills have been said to be the safest means of investment. Are they really?  People believe that they are because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the Federal government, with a high and fast rate of maturity. However, the returns are low and it is possible for the government to default in repayment.


Other forms of investments also come with their pros and cons. They may not be the safest either, because of the high risk involved, the rate of fluctuation and the liquidity rate. This is why we are introducing to you, SMEs as the new asset class and the safest place to invest some extra cash.


Small and Medium scale enterprises make significant contributions to the development of the country’s economy such as an increase in employment, creation of wealth in the country and serving as a major contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). There are several profitable small businesses which may offer better returns on investments, considerable amount of risk and less volatile as compared with the frequently trade stocks and other assets classes.


Established enterprises that are well managed always make profit, so there’s the possibility of a high rate of returns on the investment. Investing in SMEs may be a risky venture, but it does bring about high returns. It all depends on the field and sector you invest in.
Here’s why we think SMEs are the safest means of investment.


## They are innovative

Entrepreneurs are innovative individuals, always coming up with new ideas and plans to grow and remain in business. Investing in SMEs is equal to investing in ideas and new innovations. This encourages investment and equally boosts the economy.


## You serve as a contributor to the economy

Investing in SMEs this way creates impact in your society. It motivates you when a business you’ve invested in is excelling and making impact in the economy. Rather than put all your eggs in one basket, work with an entrepreneur and grow the economy. Such growth occurs when you see your SMEs making waves in their field, employing more people, thus reducing the rate of unemployment in the country. This brings satisfaction.
