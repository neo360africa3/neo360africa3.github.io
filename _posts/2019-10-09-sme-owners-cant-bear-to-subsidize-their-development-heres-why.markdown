SMEs create 2 out of every 3 new jobs! Despite this, they are often overlooked and underserved. Small and Medium Scale Enterprises are responsible for the development of new products and services which keeps the economy going. Due to its dynamic nature, SMEs are prone to a high mortality rate caused by sudden shifts in economic policies amongst other factors.

According to research, more than half of SMEs are unable to fund their business ambitions. While there might be an increase in revenue, some find it difficult to reach their business goals. Some of these goals include employing more staff, opening other branches, launching new products and more. <br/>

However, challenges faced by SMEs include lack of access to affordable finance, skilled workforce, multiplicity of taxes, high cost of doing business, huge gaps in infrastructure and more. Some SMEs were able to share the challenges they face. <br/>

“I own a small shop in Yaba where I sell clothes and business has been good. I make an average of 150 to 300 thousand naira per month and would love to open another shop in Lagos market, but the responsibilities are too much. I am a widow and have to send my two children to school, I also have to pay rent, in fact, I still take care of my late husband’s mother. I thank God things have been good, but I really wish to open another shop.” <br/>

“I started a laundry business in 2017 where I wash, iron and mend clothes for people. I want to grow bigger than this, but not many people are interested in what I’m doing. Some people think it’s just to wash and iron, but it’s more than that and takes a lot of skill. Because of the lack of interest, I’ve also lost employees. Some end up damaging the clothes, while others run away with them to sell. Another issue is power. They don’t provide us with enough electricity, so I have a backup generator. The cost of maintaining the generator and servicing it is not easy. I also have to buy fuel regularly. If all these costs were not there, I believe I would have gone far by now.” <br/>

Without the necessary funds and facilities to grow, the economy will remain stagnant and entrepreneurs will lose their businesses.
