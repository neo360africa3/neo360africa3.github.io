As an entrepreneur, time management cannot be overemphasized. Maybe you’re not a full time entrepreneur and you also work a 9 to 5, or you have a family you need to take care of. Even full time entrepreneurs have engaging activities that may be hindering them from achieving their goal. Here are a few tips on how to manage your time effectively;

## Plan your day

Planning has to be top on the list. This involves scheduling what has to be done and when it must be done. This puts you in check and enables you control your tasks and time in order to achieve your goals. Remember, “The key is not to prioritize what’s on your schedule but to schedule your priorities.” – Stephen Covey

## Start with simple tasks

While planning your day, remember to start with the simple tasks and keep the complex ones for later. You cannot start with the complex ones, because by the time it would have finished, you may not have enough time or strength for the simple ones. Starting with simple tasks gives you a head start and boosts your productivity.

## Take a break

Your plan better include a break. It could be overwhelming working from one task to the other, brainstorming and engaging in lengthy business meetings. Ensure you take a break once in a while to allow your mind and body rest; this boosts creativity and promotes efficiency.
