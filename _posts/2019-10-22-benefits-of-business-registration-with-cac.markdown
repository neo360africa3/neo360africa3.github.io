Many entrepreneurs, especially small business owners fail to realise the importance of business registration in Nigeria. Some see it as a long and tough process that does not add much value to their existing business. Contrary to this popular belief, we observed that there are a lot of advantages of registering your business with CAC. 

 
The <a href="https://www.new.cac.gov.ng/home/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Corporate Affairs Commission</a> is the body in charge of business registration in Nigeria. With offices all over the country and an official website, they are very reachable and there’s no reason why you shouldn’t get your business registered.
If you’ve been stalling on getting your business registered, the following reasons will convince you:

* Business registration is important to engage with banks and other lending platforms. First, you need a corporate account for your business. Without one, you cannot get a business loan. A business account is also better for ease of transactions, rather than a personal account. Kindly note that your CAC certificate will be required to open a business account.

* Business registration helps separate you from liabilities and risks. While getting your business registered, this separates you from whatever challenges your business may face as it now becomes a separate legal entity. It is a safety measure.

* The registration of your business also increases your image and credibility. A business that is not registered under the Corporate Affairs Commission will not be taken seriously by clients and potential customers. 

* Finally, it is required by the law to get your business name registered by the CAC. How does one go about this? – Ensure you have two choices because there is a possibility that one of the names would have been taken.

The next step is to reserve the name. Pick up the CAC registration form (for a fee) and fill it appropriately. If the names selected have already been taken, you will have to purchase another form and register again.

Once the name reservation has been successful, you may proceed to register your business name.
