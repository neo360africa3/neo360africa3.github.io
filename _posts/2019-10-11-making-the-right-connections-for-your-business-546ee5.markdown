Another business idea just popped into your head and you don’t know how to start. You don’t know how you are going to achieve this big dream of yours. You need connection; strong business connections that can help you take your business to the next level. Ensure you make connections with the right people that can help you build your career and grow your business. 
Here’s a guide to making the right connections and keeping them.

## Identify your purpose and values

You should know your worth and your goal. These two factors are essential in making the right connections. Without a purpose, there is no point networking. What are your goals? They must be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time bound (SMART).
Ensure that you have an agenda of what you aim to achieve in the industry before meeting with the key players. If you have no value, then you are worth nothing. What are you bringing to the table? You should have key features that make you unique.

## Educate yourself

In order to make the right connections, you need to educate yourself about the field you are going into, the competitive rate, the pros and the cons, and much more. Educating yourself about such matters boosts your confidence when it’s time to network.

## Identify prominent people in your field

Prominent people in the field need to be identified and well known. This way, you are able to make connections with the right people and not just anybody. You need to make connections with people that can influence your growth in the industry.

## Attend key networking events

Put yourself out there! Networking events are very beneficial for the youth, the unemployed, the employed, the CEOs and even entrepreneurs. Networking events serve as an avenue to meet with important people that can help build you up in your business. However, make sure to attend the important ones that relate to what you are doing. Do not attend these events empty handed. Go with writing materials, business cards and your phone (for pictures). Make sure to interact and not just sit and watch.

## Use LinkedIn

LinkedIn is a great social media tool. It is easier to reach out to connections by messaging them. Make sure you get straight to the point and explain your purpose for reaching out. LinkedIn is also a great platform for maintaining connections. Make sure you keep in touch and follow up.
