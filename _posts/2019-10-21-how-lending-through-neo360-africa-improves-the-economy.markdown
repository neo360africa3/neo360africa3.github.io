NEO360 Africa is a peer-to-peer lending platform established for the development of SMEs. SMEs contribute significantly to the growth of the Nigerian economy and NEO360 is set to help small businesses get better which in turn further improves the economy. 
 
## How do SMEs improve the economy?

* **They create new job opportunities** – Rather than sit back and do nothing, Nigerians learn various skills and traits which become a small business creating wealth for them and their household a source of wealth to them. In addition, SMEs employ more staff to learn these skills and traits, thus creating more job opportunities and reducing the rate of unemployment in the country.


* **They make efficient use of local resources** – With the ban on the importation of various goods, and the charges that come with imports, small business owners utilise the raw materials readily available in the country. This reduces the cost of goods and services provided.


* **They reduce the rate of poverty** – As SMEs continually develop and more people get employed, the rate of poverty reduces as the standard of living in the country increases.


* **They are continuously innovative** – SMEs are very innovative. They come up with new ideas, new processes to complement the existing business. Such innovations serve as useful ideas that could contribute to the development of the country in various sectors.


* **They are existent in various sectors** – The existence of SMEs in various sectors gives room for expansion and development of the economy and other sectors such as Agriculture, Technology, Entertainment, etc.


* **They are quick to adapt to economic changes** – Small and medium enterprises may be affected by the economic conditions of the country, but that doesn’t stop them. Most entrepreneurs are resilient and continually work efficiently in order to make waves in their fields. <br/>
