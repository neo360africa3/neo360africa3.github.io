With the advancement in technology, it is important for businesses to branch out and adopt the use of online innovations. The internet has created electronic or virtual marketplaces where business transactions can take place without any geographical barriers. Bill Gates said, *“if your business is not on the web, then your business will be out of business.”* <br/>

Here are 5 reasons you should take your business to the online market place:
## 24 hour availability
Expanding your business to the online market place gives you global access without time barriers. Your business is up and available every day for 24 hours. There are no opening or closing hours, thus you are always available.

## Wider reach
Online markets have the advantage of a greater reach. Your products are not just limited to those within your country or state. There are no geographical barriers, thus the entire world is your potential customer.

## Low cost of marketing
The internet serves as a platform to advertise your products and services at little or no cost. This can be done by using various platforms such as blogs, social media, emails and web links.

## Broadens relationships
Engaging in online business broadens your relationships as an entrepreneur. Online marketplaces could lead you to various social platforms and forums to connect with individuals in the same field and business as you from all over the world.

## Flexibility
An online business doesn’t require you to be at the workstation supervising your workers or checking up on clients. Engaging in online business allows you to be flexible with your schedule, thus providing the opportunity to engage in other activities such as school, family, vacation and more.
