We’ve learnt here that borrowing is not always a bad idea. Why? Sometimes businesses need loan to be able to achieve your desired business goal. As justifiable as this may sound, there is another end of the spectrum that involves taking loans to finance depreciating assets usually referred to as bad debt. Determining whether or not a debt is good or bad involves a deep analysis of the specific reason for which the loan is taken. 

GOOD DEBTS
“No debt is a good debt,” they say. However, if taking loan helps to build or grow your business, generate more income and increase your net worth, it is a good debt. In simple terms, a good debt is one that is a sensible investment in your financial future, should leave you better off in the long-term and should not have a negative impact on your overall financial position.

A good debt means you have a clear and specific reason for taking out the loan, and a realistic repayment plan that allows you clear the debt as quickly as possible, or in a series of regular and affordable payments. 

Acquiring a loan to expand is a typical example of good debt. The business is doing great, you have customers come in and out of the store regularly, but you are running out of space to keep your goods. This means it’s time to expand, open another store, but you can’t afford rent in another area. This calls for a loan! Borrowing for such a purpose is a good idea because it is the expansion of value. However, before acquiring a loan for such purpose, ensure you have conducted adequate research and you are sure the environment is a good fit for expansion.

The purchase of new equipment. Here is another example of good debt. Maybe you run a fashion line and one of the machines has been damaged, leading to a decline in meeting the demands of customers. Obviously, a new sewing machine is needed to get things moving again. A loan may be required to purchase this equipment. Please note that equipment purchased should be a requisite for the business and should be value adding.

Other examples of good debts in business include the purchase of inventory, the employment of more staff, the renovation of premises and other value adding purposes. Any debt taken that is not value oriented is a bad debt.

BAD DEBTS
While good debt has the potential to increase a person’s net worth, its generally considered to be bad debt if you are borrowing to purchase depreciating assets. In other words, if it doesn’t add value or generate income, you shouldn’t go into debt to acquire it. Businesses should carefully evaluate their reasons for borrowing before dabbling into it.

As a business owner, you might be thinking of getting a car to help ease mobility and run errands that make up your everyday business life. The cons of taking out a loan to acquire a car might outweigh the pros. These cons include the increased liability that stems from the cost of maintenance, the vehicle losing its value over time, the cost of insurance. 

Other forms of bad debt would be taking out a loan to buy clothes, electronics or other necessities. If you cannot pay cash for them, you should at least consider setting your ego aside and settling for lesser brands that you can afford. 

Are you thinking of acquiring a loan? Make sure you weigh the pros and cons. What benefit it would serve your business? What is the accruable interest rate on the loan and the specified repayment plan?
