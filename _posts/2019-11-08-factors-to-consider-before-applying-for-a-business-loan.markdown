You should know what loan term best suits your business need.  A loan taken to boost cash flow might not have the same loan term as that needed to launch a new product. It is therefore advisable to spread your repayment plan if need be.

## What type of loan do I apply for?

NEO360 offers two types of loans; the secured loan and the unsecured loan. The type of loan depends on your credit score and the loan purpose you need help with. The Secured loan allows you to borrow up to ₦2million and involves you pledging a business asset or collateral. The unsecured loan on the other side allows to borrow up to ₦500,000 and does not involve any form of asset pledging.
