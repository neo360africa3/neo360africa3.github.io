### Identify the cause and analyse your costs

For you to be spending more than you’re making in business, something must be wrong somewhere. Conduct a thorough analysis of your costs and identify the reason for the negativity. Maybe at some point, excess and unnecessary payments were made. If it is possible, cut down on all irrelevant costs.

### Employ new ways to increase revenue

Maybe the problem isn’t with how much you’re spending and you just need to step up your game in the marketplace. How can you increase revenue? There must be something you’re not doing. Methods to increase revenue include marketing, engaging in partnerships, improving customer relationships, expanding your marketplace and more.

### Operate with care

Never engage in enticing transactions just to stay in business: if the margin of a transaction is not favorable, you need to let it go. It is unwise for a business owner to assume that what he cannot gain with margin, he will gain with volume. If you are losing money on the transaction, greater volumes of that transaction mean you will lose more money.

### Stick to your budget

A budget performs the function of managing your money effectively. If the budget is not adequately followed, it could lead to negative cash flow due to the mismanagement of money. Sticking to your budget prevents mismanagement and mishandling of funds.

### Engage with investors

An increase in revenue may not be the only solution to negative cash flow. Seeking a loan could be the plus you need to revive your business and turn the cash flow positive.
