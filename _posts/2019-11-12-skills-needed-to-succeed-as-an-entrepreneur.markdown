**Communication skills** – Effective communication skills is needed by an entrepreneur to be able to communicate with diverse people. An SME would need to communicate with potential investors, clients, partners, employees and more, all from various backgrounds. As an entrepreneur, it is pertinent that you are able to pitch your business to anyone for them to believe in your brand and even go as far as investing. Until there’s an understanding of the message, communication hasn’t taken place. You might be required to take online classes or learn a new language to communicate effectively.
