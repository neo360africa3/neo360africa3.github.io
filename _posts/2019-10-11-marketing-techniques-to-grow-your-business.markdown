Marketing is an essential tool for business growth. Marketing builds awareness, increases sales and engages customers. In order to grow and promote your business, marketing strategies are important. Key marketing strategies to grow your business include:

## Social media 

Research has it that more than 2.5 billion people use social media, thus making it one of the most powerful tools for marketing. The top social media networks highly used for marketing include Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn. These networks allow business owners to pay for traffic and exposure which increases their reach. Emails also serve as a powerful social media tool with the adoption of platforms such as Mailchimp, Sender, Drip and many more. While using social media for marketing, ensure you are consistent with the information and the frequency of your posts. It would be a good thing to keep your subscribers and potential clients about business updates such as new products, prices and services.

## Event sponsorship

In Nigeria where events happen almost every day, it shouldn’t be hard to seek events that could be sponsored. Ensure these are events where your potential customers will be situated. Such events may allow the use of canopies, banners, stickers and other materials at the event which could boost your growth. It’s a win-win for both of you!

## Engage influencers

Influencers boost visibility online and on social media. Influencers may not be the big guns that are very popular. Start with your network, talk to people and let them promote your business. However, if you choose to engage with the big influencers, be ready to pay their fee. These influencers must have something in common with your business and must be able to promote it well. 

## Seek partnership

Partnerships are key. Partner with brands that have similar goals with your business. Ensure that you engage in something similar and inform them that you wish to work together.
