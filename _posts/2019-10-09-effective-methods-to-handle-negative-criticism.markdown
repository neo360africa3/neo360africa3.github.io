*The customer is always right.* Is this true? It can be quite tough for entrepreneurs when they put in a lot of effort into a product and are not appreciated for it. <br/>


However, Sean Harper, co-founder of Kin Insurance says, "Feedback is useful. Once I started thinking this way, it made me realize I'm grateful for the opportunity to see an experience from another point of view and hopefully improve."
Not many people know how to take such feedback. Here are a few things to do when faced with an angry customer: <br/>

## **Understand the problem**

In order to understand the problem, one should keep quiet, listen and reflect on what they’ve been told. Understanding the problem would enable you proffer a valuable solution to it. This would prevent more problems and enable customer satisfaction.

## **Apologise**

Whether you agree with the customer or not, an apology should be given. This shows that you care and are interested in the customer’s opinions. After rendering the apology, engage them in conversation to know what can be done to serve them better. However, do not over apologise and feel too guilty, some people may take that for granted and try to belittle you.

## **Do not let your emotions kick in**

Negative feedback should not be taken too personal. Embrace criticism and use it as an opportunity to improve on your business. Learn from your mistakes and move on. Learn from Mauricio Cardenal who says;
"One of the most profound lessons I've learned in my life is that we should not take things too personally. Yes, negative feedback is painful sometimes, but I know that my actions aren't a reflection of me."

## **Identify the cause of the problem**

Identifying the cause of the problem is one of the first steps to take in order to avoid negative feedback another time. If a customer wasn’t satisfied with the product or service provided, try to identify what went wrong.

## **See it as an opportunity to improve**

While not everyone is open to criticism and negative feedback, some use it as an opportunity to improve. This leads to increased performance and productivity.
