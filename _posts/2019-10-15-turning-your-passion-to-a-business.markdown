A passion is a feeling of excitement or desire towards something. What do you love to do without coercion? That’s your passion.

Conduct your research and find out more about your passion. How can you improve? What resources are needed to venture into a business? Read the stories of others.

## **Engage with people**

Before venturing into a business, communicate with people, engage with them and find out what they want. Do they need your service? It would be sad to turn such passion into a business just to find out people are not interested. 

## **Start!**

Once you’ve gathered adequate knowledge, start your business. It should be fun making money from an activity you are passionate about. Remember what they say, “Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.” Enjoy your new role as an entrepreneur!
